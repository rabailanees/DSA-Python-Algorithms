# DSA Python Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental **Data Structures** and **Algorithms (DSA)**. It includes popular algorithms like sorting, and data structures such as linked lists, trees, stacks, and queues. The goal of this repository is to provide clean and easy-to-understand code for key DSA concepts and help developers and learners improve their problem-solving skills.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly), Stacks, Queues, Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees), and more.

## Requirements

To run the algorithms, you'll need:

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-python-algorithms.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd dsa-python-algorithms
    ```

3. There are no additional dependencies for running the algorithms, as this project only requires Python.

## Running the Algorithms

You can run any of the Python files by using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

For example, to run the **Bubble Sort** algorithm:

```bash
python sorting/bubble_sort.py
```
